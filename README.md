## configuring

all configuring is dont through *conf.json*, basically a metric is something you want to read from solace and put onto the eventbus. the HTML client subscribes to the eventbus on topics like "vpns", "stats", "queues" and "Some VPN Name" 

a typical *metric* configuration contains:

|Name    |Description|
|--------|-----------|
|request |request to POST to the appliance|
|interval|the interval in *ms* to repeat requests and publish responses|
|config |specific metric's config|

the *config* options are:

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|data_path|path hinting to aid the client javascript to extract the neccesary data points. |
|view|the name of the view|
|handler|the javascript function in the client that can handle the data and view|

### request

the request is a string which is put into the request body.

e.g. `<rpc semp-version=\"soltr/6_0\"><show><alarm></alarm></show></rpc>`

### interval

millisecond interval to set the repeating timer for.

### config

general config for the metric

#### data_path

the data_path is a "." separated string of object id's within the JSON response . the HTML client uses this to reach the object which hold the keys and values of the desired metric. it is used by the various view handlers in conjunction with the shift_data javascript function in the client.

e.g. `"rpc-reply.rpc.show.memory.physical-memory"`

you can determin the data_path for a request by just looking over the raw responses from the solace appliance. e.g.

```sh
$> curl -d "<rpc semp-version=\"soltr/6_0\"><show><memory></memory></show></rpc>" -u "ro_user:ro_pass" "http://solace/SEMP
<rpc-reply semp-version="soltr/6_0">
  <rpc>
    <show>
      <memory>
        <physical-memory>
          <memory-info>
            <type>Memory</type>
            <total-in-kb>16107540</total-in-kb>
            <used-in-kb>5800592</used-in-kb>
            <free-in-kb>10306948</free-in-kb>
            <buffers-in-kb>70056</buffers-in-kb>
            <cached-in-kb>697812</cached-in-kb>
            ...
            ...
```
#### view

the view is the name of a view as defined in the *views* section of the config. 

e.g. `"generic_vpn_stats"

#### handler

handler is the javascript function name in the HTML client which is capable of handling the particular response data. the javascript function needs to be imported in the *scripts* section of the index.html or similar mechanism.

e.g. `"generic_handler"`

##### handlers

within src/main/resources/webroot/js you can find handler javascript files, handlers take the JSON-ified responses from the MonitorVerticle and turn them into something plotable.

###### alarms_handler

alarms handler is a special handler for reading alarm messages and triggering a MaterielizeCSS modal to display the alarms.

###### events_handler

under development.

###### generic_handler

the generic_handler is capable of plotting a **single** object's keys and values. by that I mean the `data_path` must refer to a object with keys and values and *NOT* an array of objects. 

example json

```
"memory": {
	"stats": {
		"free": 999999999,
		"used": 2132131231 ,
		"other": {
			"somekey": "somevalue"
		}
	}
}
```

in the case above, using the *data_path* `memory.stats` would make free, used and other available to the handler. the view *specific* config in the views section can also access the `somekey` value by specifying an addition `data_path` in the view's config. 

###### redundancy_handler

under development.

###### stats_handler

currently only pulls the total msg's sent and received for use by the flipclock.

###### vpns_handler

the vpns handler slightly different to the *generic_handler* in that it CAN handle a Array object. 

### core metrics

core metrics named `stats`, `queues` and `vpns` **MUST** always be present since they control aspects of the default view.

#### stats

*stats* are total rate information for the appliance. this is currently only used by the flipclock.

#### vpns

*vpns* populates the rate-per-vpn graph on `default` view. these are stacked in the `Message Rate` graph to plot the total message rate.

#### queues

*queues* populates the spool usage per-queue graph on the `default` view. the variable `min_spool_plot` in index.html hides queues which dont have more than N msg's in the spool.

#### vpn dashboards

for each vpn you want to create a dashboard for, you need to create a "metric" definition. e.g.

```
      "metrics" : {
        ...
        ...
        "Some Vpn": {
          "request": "<rpc semp-version=\"soltr/6_0\"><show><message-vpn><vpn-name>vpn_name_here</vpn-name><stats></stats></message-vpn></show></rpc>",
          "interval": 5000,
          "config": {
            "data_path": "rpc-reply.rpc.show.message-vpn.vpn.stats",
            "view": "generic_vpn_stats",
            "handler": "generic_handler"
          }
        },
        "Some Other VPN": {
          "request": "<rpc semp-version=\"soltr/6_0\"><show><message-vpn><vpn-name>another_vpn_name</vpn-name><stats></stats></message-vpn></show></rpc>",
          "interval": 5000,
          "config": {
            "data_path": "rpc-reply.rpc.show.message-vpn.vpn.stats",
            "view": "generic_vpn_stats",
            "handler": "generic_handler"
          }
        }
      }

```


### views

views control what keys are extracted and graphed, the view describe the graphs to the javascript client which runs in the browser. 

each *key* under `show` in the `config` element refers to a item in the JSON document at the *data_path*.

each `view` object is used by the specified *handler* in the `metric` config, so the handler's could potentially have different view configs. the generic_handler accepts the following keys:

* show
* chart_type
* div
* chart_length
* data_path

#### show

this is a JsonArray of key's whos values you want to plot. make sure that the values make sense on the same graph! 

#### chart_type

any of the supported chart_type arguments for canvasJs. examples are:

* area
* stackedColumn
* stackedColumn100
* stackedArea
* stackedArea100
* ...

#### div

the MaterializeCSS framework supports the standard 12-column system, index.html defines the following grid system.

|           s12 / l8         | s12 / l4 |
|------------------|------------|
|bigcharts         |   charts  |

| s12 / l4 | s12 / l4 | s12 / l4 |
|---|---|---
|smallcharts-1|smallcharts-2|smallcharts-3|

#### chart_length

the number of samples to store in chart's data map. if you want a dashboard time window of the last *6* minutes, and are publishing metrics every *5* seconds, then use this formula: 

`(6 minutes * 60 seconds) / 5 seconds = 72 samples`

#### data_path

`data_path` at this level specifies additional objects to descend into in compliment to the data_path already used at a metric level. see the example below.

#### example

view config example showing how it all fits together.

```
      "views": {
        "default": {}, // a view who's handlers dont accept view config.
        "generic_vpn_stats": {
          "Message Rate": { // a human readable name for the chart
            "show": [
              "current-egress-rate-per-second",
              "current-ingress-rate-per-second"
            ],
            "chart_type": "stackedColumn", // canvasjs chartType
            "div": "smallcharts-1", // div to place the chart in
            "chart_length": 20 // the chart length in samples
          },
          "Ingress Discards": {
            "show": [
              "msg-spool-discards",
              "ttl-exceeded"
            ],
            "counter": true, // these are counters
            "data_path": "ingress-discards", // the keys are in this sub object
            "div": "smallcharts-3",
            "chart_length": 10
          },
	  ...
	  ...
  
```

## client side

the client is a HTML websocket application, which will connect to the SolaceMonitor verticle through the Server verticle and then download the configuration from the server. for each metric defined it will register a handler and a menu item.

the MonitorVerticle sends responses from to the client. the client then passes the message on to a handler as defined in the metric configuration. the handler is tasked with digging through the data and storing it in the "data" arrays.

the view configs are sent along with the response to the client to enable the client to plot the data as desired.

see the index.html for layout of MaterializeCSS divs.

## periodic metrics

metrics defined in conf.json are polled by the server and broadcast to their respective topics.

## requesting metrics

in addition to the periodic publishing of metrics, metrics can be requested from the MonitorVerticle via the eventbus, which is extended to HTML clients and other VertX.io verticles.  

to make a request, send a message on the eventbus to the `metrics` topic e.g:

```
eb.send("metrics", "memory", req -> {
  // do something with the response
});
```

## building

the gradle task *shadowJar* will build a executable jar

```
./gradlew shadowJar
```

## running

when running as a fatJar, remember to specify the alternate logging implementation.


```
JAVA_OPTS="-Dvertx.logger-delegate-factory-class-name=io.vertx.core.logging.SLF4JLogDelegateFactory"
JAVA_HOME="/opt/jdk1.8.0_45"
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java $JAVA_OPTS -jar solace-dashboards-1.2.1-fat.jar -conf conf.json
```
